My approach to the challenge has essentially been the same as for the Boris Bikes. It made sense that the airports should control the allowing of landing and taking off, as in real life.

Weather has been pulled out into a separate class, as it isn't something is controlled by planes or airports.

TDD principles kept to diligently during the production of the code.
